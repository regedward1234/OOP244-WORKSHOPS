I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

For workshop 3, I built on things I learned from previous workshops' like allocating and deallocating dynamic memory. 
Something new I had to implement in this workshop is a constructor for the Food class in part 2. Although I could have used the Empty function to set everything to 0, I created a constructor to try and see how it works. Another thing I learned 
while doing this workshop is more about cout and how to format it. Lastly, the biggest thing I learned from this workshop
is about classes. I learned that a class is private by default and that we can use "public:" to make member functions 
be accessible to client code. The data members can be accessed by public and private functions. The member functions
help in getting values from client code into the class by assigning it to the private data members. An important thing I 
woiuld need to keep in mind for future workshops is initializing the data members to an empty state, as they can create bugs later on.
